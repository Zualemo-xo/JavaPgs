Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that 
is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application 
developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java
code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java 
virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. 
The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities 
than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities 
such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available 
in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular 
programming languages in use according to GitHub,[18][19] particularly for 
client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.
